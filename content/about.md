I am an undergraduate junior at Harvard studying CS and music and an aspiring product manager for audio software and hardware. I love tackling real-world problems from an analytical and creative approach. This website documents my work for the class "Physics 70: Intro to Digital Fabrication". When I'm not working on the assignments for this class, I write songs and edit for The Wave Magazine. I love rewatching Frozen II, eating Korean food, and learning physics.

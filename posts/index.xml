      <description>Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture This week, I created a Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day themed rotating bird as a kinetic sculpture. This was definitely a journey &amp;ndash; it evolved into something much more fun that I anticipated!
Materials I used the M0 Metro Circuit from Adafruit, a potentiometer, a moter, and the breadboard from the PS 70 kit to start. Circuit inspired by class:  Circuit 
Attached the motor to the lego wheels and 3D printed structures from the hardware packet.</description>

      <description>Press Fit Construction Kit For this assignment, I collaborated with Hugh and Amy to create a cardboard press-fit kit for lampshades. I got this idea from a beautiful wooden lamp that I had seen on the internet:

      <description>For my final project, I aim to build a midi controller where a person can change instrument sounds just by holding their hand up or horizontally or down. Because of the &amp;ldquo;hands off&amp;rdquo; concept, the musician/producer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on a bulky piece of hardware. The project could incorporate different sensors such as light, movement, and visual sensors (such as a camera). This product would simulate a two-dimensional plane, where each axis represents some customizable parameter to an instrument.</description>

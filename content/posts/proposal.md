For my final project, I aim to build a midi controller where a person can change instrument sounds just by holding their hand up or horizontally or down. Because of the "hands off" concept, the musician/producer doesn't have to rely on a bulky piece of hardware. The project could incorporate different sensors such as light, movement, and visual sensors (such as a camera). This product would simulate a two-dimensional plane, where each axis represents some customizable parameter to an instrument. For example, the axes can control sustain and release:

As a college student and musician whose two homes are thousands of miles away, I often find it challengeing to create music when the instruments I'm used to hide on the other side of the country. This brought me to wanting a digital instrument that was portable in design and flexible in musicality. 

A greater goal would be to intregrate my technology into popular DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) and their tools (such as Alchemy in Logic Pro), so that it is more widely accessible to musicians.

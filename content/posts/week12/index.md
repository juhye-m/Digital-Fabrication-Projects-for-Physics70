## Week 11

## Molding and Casting

This week was molding and casting week, so I looked around my room for something interesting to make a mold out of. After feeling like I didn't have something cool (I left my trinkets at home), I finally decided to make a mold of my perfume bottle cap. It looks like this!

I liked how the bottom sat flat on the ground, and how the figure resembles a human. I thought it would be real fun to make popsicles in the shape! I found that the sunglasses especially would be special as it would be something difficult to reinvent without a mold.

I debated between doing a two-part mold versus just one part. eventually, I went with the one-part mold since it seemed like they would produce similar results if I cut the mold at the sunglasses to take the figure out later.

I put the figure in a cup and poured the mixed silicone in. Unfortunately, it didn't reach the top to completely engulf the figure. As a workaround, I simply slathered the top of the head with some silicone and hoped that it would still provide some structure (which it did as you'll see!). I held the figure in place with a stick, but then later just held the figure, as it kept rising and even pushing the stick upwards. I thought about putting rocks inside the figure as well, where I had taped the bottom, but it was too late for that. After I finished, I let the mold hardern for several hours.

It was extrememly difficult to get the mold out of the cup. I cut out the edges with a kinfe, but it took me longer than I expected.

Finally, after getting the mold out of the cup, I cut the mold paralell to the ground where the figure's sunglasses were. By doing so, I was able to remove the figure while keeping the mold and its intracacies intact. Then, I filled the mold with orange juice and froze it to form a popsicle. Here is the finished product:

If I were to do this again, I would 
- make sure there is enough silicon to fill the mold cup
- use a narrower cup to maximize the height
- use a paper or disposable plastic cup so that I can easily rip the cup off of the mold
- mold a figure that is easier to work with (but is still interesting)!

## Final Project work

This week, I compiled a new page to document all my final project work and ideas here. I then assembled my 3D printed model of my midi keyboard casing, and explored the speaker component, a new output device that was sent to me!

## Speakers


## 3D model

For my final project, I wanted to case my midi controller in a mini piano-keyboard. Since a huge goal of my final project was to create a portable instrument, it was important to keep the casing minimal! I got the original files from thingiverse. I then edited (with the help of Professor Melenbrink) the top and bottom files to smooth out the logos and to cut out a space for the TCP display. Here are the STL files.

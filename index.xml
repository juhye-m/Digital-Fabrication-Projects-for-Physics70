        <description>Week 4: Microcontroller Programming This week, I created a simple button-controlled music player!
Materials I used the M0 Metro Circuit from Adafruit, a piezo speaker, a button, and the breadboard from the PS 70 kit to start.
I first used the button circuit from class as inspiration. I attached a button and a resistor from ground to one of its legs. Then I connected this leg to digital input 8 so that I can program the button&amp;rsquo;s functionality.</description>

        <description>Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture This week, I created a Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day themed rotating bird as a kinetic sculpture. This was definitely a journey &amp;ndash; it evolved into something much more fun that I anticipated!
Materials I used the M0 Metro Circuit from Adafruit, a potentiometer, a moter, and the breadboard from the PS 70 kit to start. Circuit inspired by class:  Circuit 
Attached the motor to the lego wheels and 3D printed structures from the hardware packet.</description>

        <description>Press Fit Construction Kit For this assignment, I collaborated with Hugh and Amy to create a cardboard press-fit kit for lampshades. I got this idea from a beautiful wooden lamp that I had seen on the internet:

I realized that none of us were artists, and so we decided to create geometric patterns that would create a &amp;ldquo;starlight&amp;rdquo; effect over a lightbulb, like these:</description>

        <title>PS 70 Project Proposal</title>

        <description>For my final project, I aim to build a midi controller where a person can change instrument sounds just by holding their hand up or horizontally or down. Because of the &amp;ldquo;hands off&amp;rdquo; concept, the musician/producer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on a bulky piece of hardware. The project could incorporate different sensors such as light, movement, and visual sensors (such as a camera). This product would simulate a two-dimensional plane, where each axis represents some customizable parameter to an instrument.</description>

        <description>Week 5: 3D This week, I started an motion sensored alarm watch model.
Fusion 360 This model is inspired by the Apple Watch wrist band that ibudman! created.
Here, I used components from the PS70 kit, and imported them into my watch file through the insert function in Fusion 360. I used the Arduino microcontroller, piezo buzzer, battery 5V, and the accelerometer gyroscope. The microcontroller would hold the program that would play the buzzer while the gyroscope was not detecting movement.</description>

        <description>Week 6: Sensors This week, I used an accelerometer to measure the XYZ location and the acceration of my breadboard!
Materials I used the M0 Metro Circuit from Adafruit, and an Adafruit lis3dh accelerometer from the ps70 kit.
I followed along this Adafruit Guide! at first in order to gain a better understanding of how this sensor works.
How It Works The Adafruit LIS3DH triple-Axis Accelerometer Breakout has three axis sensing.</description>
